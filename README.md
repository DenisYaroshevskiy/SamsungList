# SamsungList
A task from a samsung intervew.

I've made some bad mistakes on interiew,
due to, I hope, nerves, lack of time etc.

The list of mistakes, that I'm sure I've maid:
1) using vector for memory storage: pushing back in a vector
   invalidates all pointers inside of it, for obvious reasons.
   
2) for removing an element by a reference to node
   I moved every single element, instead of one move assigment
   
3) Detecing a loop wasn't done correctly at all
