# SamsungList
A task from a samsung intervew.

I've made some horrible mistakes on interiew,
due to, I hope, nerves, lack of time etc.

I hope, that this attempt to do it right make them 
change their mind and considere me as a valid candidate
(unlikely)

The list of mistakes, that I'm sure I've maid:
1) using vector for memory storage: pushing back in a vector
   invalidates all pointers inside of it, for obvious reasons.
   I even knew about it, but for some reason
   
2) for removing an element by a reference to node
   I moved every single element, very likely,
   with mistakes
   
3) Detecing a loop was done in 3 minutes, without any attempt to think
